      <p>
        Hi, I'm Ritesh Sutrave, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a keen interest in software development, web technologies, and artificial intelligence. I have always been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems, and this curiosity led me to pursue a career in full-stack development and machine learning. Education & Learning Journey I earned my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from MIT College of Railway Engineering and Research, Barshi, with a 7.85 CGPA. Before that, I completed my Diploma in Computer Science and Engineering from A.G. Patil Polytechnic Institute, Solapur, scoring 74%. Throughout my education, I have always been eager to learn and explore new technologies. I built a strong foundation in programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python, and C#, and gained experience working with databases such as MySQL and MongoDB. Career Journey & Experience My journey in software development began with building small projects, which quickly evolved into working on full-scale applications. Over time, I developed skills in front-end and back-end development, working with frameworks like React.js, Flask, Django, and ASP.NET. Front-End Development Internship I completed an internship at OCTANET Private Limited, where I worked as a Front-End Developer. My key responsibilities included: ‚úîÔ∏è Developing responsive web interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. ‚úîÔ∏è Working with React.js to build interactive UI components. ‚úîÔ∏è Enhancing website performance and improving user experience. ‚úîÔ∏è Collaborating with the backend team to integrate APIs and databases (MongoDB, MySQL). This internship helped me refine my UI/UX skills, improve my problem-solving abilities, and gain real-world experience in modern web development technologies. Key Projects I have worked on multiple projects that strengthened my technical expertise: Diabetic Retinopathy Classification System ‚Äì A web application that helps in early disease detection using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks). Spotify Clone ‚Äì A music streaming platform offering ad-free, premium songs. Gaming Website (Far Cry Clone) ‚Äì A website providing free premium games to users. Web-Based Photoshop Tool ‚Äì A platform for small-scale photographers to showcase their work. These projects gave me hands-on experience in full-stack development, database management, and cloud deployment. Technical Skills & Certifications I am committed to continuous learning and have earned several certifications: ‚úîÔ∏è Full-Stack JavaScript Development (MongoDB, Node.js, React.js) ‚úîÔ∏è Python Object-Oriented Programming ‚úîÔ∏è Flask Essential Training ‚úîÔ∏è Ethical Hacking: Introduction to Cybersecurity ‚úîÔ∏è Introduction to Prompt Engineering for Generative AI Additionally, I completed Python training at Besant Technology, further strengthening my expertise in backend development and automation. Hobbies & Interests Outside of work, I love to explore new technologies, travel, and play cricket. I enjoy learning about AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity, and I actively take part in tech events and hackathons. I also volunteered at Avishkar 2022, an event organized by Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar Solapur University, showcasing my commitment to community engagement and continuous growth. Final Thoughts I am a self-motivated, hardworking, and adaptable individual who thrives in challenging environments. I believe in continuous learning and innovation, and I am always looking for opportunities to apply my skills in real-world projects. Let‚Äôs connect and create something amazing together! üöÄ
